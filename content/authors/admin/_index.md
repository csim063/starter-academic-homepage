I am interested in what drives landscape level biodiversity distributions and persistence. My interest surrounding these topics is embedded in a passion for conservation and a belief that an understanding of these larger spatial-temporal processes is key to predicting the most sustainable and beneficial management approaches. My expertise is in the theoretical underpinnings and modelling of species and biodiversity distributions, landscape ecology, population and community dynamics, as well as, how these processes are influenced by environmental change.

I am passionate about proliferating the ideals of open science, a concept which is still in its infancy in ecology. I believe the opening of science to all interested stake holders is the best way of ensuring research findings are put into actions. As most of my research is done in a highly computational manner, I am in an ideal position to fully embrace and enhance the many new technologies driving open science.
