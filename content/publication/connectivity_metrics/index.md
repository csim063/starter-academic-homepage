abstract: "Due to increasing habitat 
fragmentation and concern about its ecological effects, there has 
been an upsurge in the use of landscape connectivity estimates in 
conservation planning. Measuring connectivity is challenging, 
resulting in a limited understanding of the efficacy of 
connectivity estimation techniques and the conditions under which 
they perform best. We evaluated the performance of four commonly 
used connectivity metrics -- Euclidean distance; least-cost paths 
(LCP) length and cost; and circuit theory's resistance distance 
-- over a variety of simulated landscapes. We developed an 
agent-based model simulating the dispersal of individuals with 
different behavioural traits across landscapes varying in their 
spatial structure. The outcomes of multiple dispersal attempts 
were used to obtain `true' connectivity. These `true' 
connectivity measures were then compared to estimates generated 
using the connectivity metrics, employing the simulated 
landscapes as cost-surfaces. The four metrics differed in the 
strength of their correlation with true connectivity; resistance 
distance showed the strongest correlation, closely followed by 
LCP cost, with Euclidean distance having the weakest. Landscape 
structure and species behavioural attributes only weakly 
predicted the performance of resistance distance, LCP cost and 
length estimates, with none predicting Euclidean distance's 
efficacy. Our results indicate that resistance distance and LCP 
cost produce the most accurate connectivity estimates, although 
their absolute performance under different conditions is 
difficult to predict. We emphasise the importance of testing 
connectivity estimates against patterns derived from independent 
data, such as those acquired from tracking studies. Our findings 
should help to inform a more refined implementation of 
connectivity metrics in conservation management."
